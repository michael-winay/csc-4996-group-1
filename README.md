Assad Logistics Trucking Website:
     This project aimed to create a website for our client's trucking company. The website would be used
     by both customers and employees interested in being hired. The website consists of six major pages
     including the home page, quote, services, contact us, about, and apply pages. The apply page was 
     designed to allow our client to be able to hire people through the website without using a third party 
     service. The services page shows services that Assad Logistics offers. The quote page contains a 
     form that allows for a customer to submit a handful of information and get a quote from the company on
     the cost of the transportation. About us tells some details about the company, and the contact page
     offers a form to contact the company along with having contact information and the address of the 
     company.
     
 Technologies:
    This site utilizes HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and JavaScript. A third party site, EmailJS, is in place to send the 
    forms to the client. Through this third party source we are able to set up templates for each of the 
    forms utilized on the website, upon clicking Submit EmailJS goes in and gathers the information in 
    the forms based on the input names and the template gets sent out to the client in a neat and easy 
    to read fashion. This method is more secure than using the built in Mailto function in HTML and overall
    offers a cleaner look when the client receives the form information.
    
Installation and Launch:
    The installation and launch of these files is fairly simple, since everything has been organized into 
    the proper places within github. Upon downloading the .zip file from Github, you will need to unzip the 
    file. The name can be kept the same or changed, it will not effect the website. Once it is unzipped 
    you can click into the files it should be a file within a file both being named csc-4996-group-1 if 
    you did not change the name. At this point all the files will show and you can simply open the index.html
    file to get to the home page of the website.
